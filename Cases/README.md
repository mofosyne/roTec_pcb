# Cases

This folder is for cases designed specifically for this device.

Typically we would just point you towards an external link, but we may have copies here if modification was required to make this design fit into it.
The license for each of the folder is based on each project's original license unless stated otherwise.

## FaketecMeshtasticCaseWithEncoder_TimurTaipov

This is based off [faketec NRF52 Meshtastic Case With Encoder Buzzer (by Timur Taipov)](https://www.printables.com/model/1102989-faketec-nrf52-meshtastic-case-with-encoderbuzzergp) but it was originally designed for the faketec v4 where the USB type-c port is offset higher due to the header pins.

The folder `FaketecMeshtasticCaseWithEncoder_TimurTaipov` in the repository contains a mostly one to one copy of the original design, except `front.stl` was adapted into `front_faketec_v5.stl` via `front_faketec_v5.scad`.

Inside `front_faketec_v5.stl` it is the same as `front.stl` but with the type-c port shifted upwards to work with this board.
